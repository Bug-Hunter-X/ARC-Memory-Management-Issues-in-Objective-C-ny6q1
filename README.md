# Objective-C ARC Memory Management Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug related to memory management in Objective-C using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  The bug involves incorrectly overriding the `retain`, `release`, or `dealloc` methods, leading to memory leaks or crashes.

## Bug Description
The `MemoryManagementBug.m` file contains a class with improperly implemented memory management methods. This results in memory leaks or unexpected behavior due to failure to release objects correctly or because of retain cycles that are not managed properly.

## Solution
The `MemoryManagementSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the class, demonstrating the correct way to override these methods to ensure proper memory management.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the application and observe the memory issues or program crashes. 
4. Compare with the solution to understand the proper implementation.

This example highlights the importance of carefully managing memory, even when using ARC. Always ensure to call `[super dealloc]` and maintain balance between retain and release operations in custom methods.
