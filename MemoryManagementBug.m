In Objective-C, a less common error stems from the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and custom retain/release methods.  If you override `retain`, `release`, or `dealloc` without meticulously following memory management rules, you can easily create subtle memory leaks or crashes. For example, failing to call `[super dealloc]` in your custom `dealloc` method can prevent the proper release of superclass resources. Another issue arises if you manually retain an object but fail to release it in a corresponding `release` method or if you introduce a retain cycle without proper handling.
