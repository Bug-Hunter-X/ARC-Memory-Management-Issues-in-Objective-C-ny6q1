The solution involves correctly implementing the retain, release, and dealloc methods.  Ensure that all manually retained objects are released at the appropriate time.  In the `dealloc` method, always call `[super dealloc]` to release resources from the superclass.  For example:

```objectivec
@implementation MyClass

- (id)retain {
    [super retain]; // Always call the super implementation
    return self;
}

- (oneway void)release {
    [super release];
}

- (void)dealloc {
    // Release any manually retained objects here
    [myObject release];
    myObject = nil; 
    [super dealloc]; // Crucial to call super
}

@end
```
Avoid retain cycles by using weak references where appropriate.  Implement proper memory management techniques and ensure careful balancing of retain and release calls. Thorough testing is crucial to avoid unexpected issues.
